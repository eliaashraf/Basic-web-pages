    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
    <!-- <a></a> are called anchors -->

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
      <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
        Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
        developers.</li>
      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
        page</a>.</li>
      <li>This is an example of
      <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
         target='_blank'>target attribute</a>, which tells where to
         display the page when the user clicks the link</li>
<!-- "_blank" specifies the <a> tab to open a website in a new tab or window-->
    </ul>

<!-- Absolute link: To refer to another website -->
<!-- Relative link: Point to another file/page within your own website -->
