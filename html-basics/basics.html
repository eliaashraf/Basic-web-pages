    <h1>Interesting is easy!</h1>
    <p>First we learn some basic HTML</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site.
      There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>LISTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element </li>
      <li>Add each item in its own list element</li>
      <li>They do not need to be in any particular order</li>
      <li><p>This is also possible!</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ORDERED LIST</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
        soon.</p>

<!--Block-level elements are always drawn on a new line, while inline elements
can affect sections of text anywhere within a line.-->


<!--HTML markup should provide semantic information about your contentâ€”not
presentational information. In other words, HTML should define the structure of
your document, leaving its appearance to CSS.-->
